I want to create Binance P2P Trade process on smart-contract, the process is: 
- Create Sell Advertise
- Set Advertise Online/Offline
- Set Min/Max for BuyOrder
- SendBuyOrder
- Confirm Transaction
- Appealing (In case the seller don't receive the transaction
- Processing platform fee
- Withdraw balance from advertise 
- Withdraw from vault (OnlyOwner)

This is currently what I can come up with, Please help me review this contract and give me any feedback.
